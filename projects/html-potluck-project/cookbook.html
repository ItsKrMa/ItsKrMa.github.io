            <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Pinch cayenne pepper, optional</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>2 tablespoons harissa paste</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>1 cup fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>3 to 5 large eggs</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>¼ cup fresh parsley leaves</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Microgreens, for garnish, optional</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Toasted bread, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the oil over medium heat in a 12-inch lidded 
                stainless steel or enamel-coated cast-iron skillet. 
                Add the onion, red pepper, salt, and several grinds 
                of fresh pepper and cook until the onion is soft and 
                translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, 
                paprika, cumin, and cayenne, if using. Stir and 
                let cook for about 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes
                and harissa paste. Simmer for 15 minutes until the 
                sauce is thickened.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add the spinach and stir until wilted. Use the back of a spoon
                to make 3 to 5 wells in the sauce. Crack in the eggs.
                Cover and cook until the eggs are set, 5 to 8 minutes.
                The timing will depend on how runny you like your egg yolks.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Season with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle 
                with the feta, parsley, avocado, and microgreens, 
                if using. Serve with toasted bread for scooping.
            </li>
        </ol>

        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1½ pounds fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
            &nbsp; 
            <li>2 tablespoons cane sugar</li>
            &nbsp; 
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            &nbsp; 
            <li>Pinch sea salt</li>
            &nbsp; 
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            &nbsp; 
            <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>½ cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                24 to 30 DeLallo Savoiardi ladyfingers, exact number will 
                depend on your baking dish
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Thinly slice half the strawberries and set aside. 
                Dice the remaining strawberries and place in a 
                medium saucepan. Add the sugar, balsamic vinegar, 
                and salt and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring, 
                until the sugar dissolves. Cover the pan and simmer, 
                stirring occasionally and reducing the heat as needed, 
                for 10 minutes, or until the strawberries cook down into 
                a juicy sauce.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Set a fine mesh strainer over a medium heatproof bowl. 
                Pass the strawberry sauce through the strainer to 
                remove the solids. Set the solids aside for assembling 
                the tiramisu. Add the water to the juices in the bowl 
                and stir to combine. Chill in the refrigerator until 
                ready to assemble the tiramisu.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                In a large bowl, mix together the mascarpone and vanilla 
                extract.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                In another large bowl, use an electric mixer or stand 
                mixer to beat the cream and powdered sugar on medium 
                speed for 5 to 8 minutes, or until soft to medium peaks 
                form. Gradually and gently fold the whipped cream into 
                the mascarpone, mixing until just combined.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Assemble the tiramisu. Dip half the ladyfingers into 
                the strawberry syrup one at a time, leaving each one 
                in the liquid just long enough to coat it on all sides. 
                Arrange the dipped ladyfingers evenly at the bottom of a 
                9x9-inch or similar baking dish, cutting them if necessary 
                to fully cover the bottom. 
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Spread half the mascarpone mixture evenly on top, 
                then evenly dot the reserved cooked strawberry solids 
                on top of the mascarpone. Top with half the sliced 
                strawberries.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Dip the remaining ladyfingers into the strawberry syrup 
                one at a time, placing them in an even layer on top of 
                the sliced strawberries. Top with the remaining mascarpone 
                mixture and remaining sliced strawberries.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or 
                overnight before slicing and serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
