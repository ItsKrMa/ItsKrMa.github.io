                <h2> Explore!</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-padding">
                    In act one, as I noted before, gameplay revolves around 
                    survival; the player does not venture too far from their 
                    escape pod and their primary goal is to search for food 
                    and water. In this segment, the player becomes familiar 
                    with the mechanics of crafting, power, tools, oxygen, 
                    and basic resources. Oxygen is perhaps the most important 
                    resource as it is the one to look out for most often. The 
                    player can upgrade their O2 tank to stay underwater for 
                    longer periods of time than the original 45 seconds. This 
                    Oxygen limit is the main factor in inhibiting further 
                    exploration both farther away from the starting point 
                    (the ‘Safe Shallows’) as well as deeper underwater. 
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-padding">
                    As the player ventures a bit farther out for each trip, 
                    they uncover a scanner, the main tool of the game, and 
                    with the tool they learn about the flora and fauna 
                    around them as well as discover blueprints for new 
                    tools and upgrades. We shift into act two: exploration 
                    when the player uncovers the blueprints for the Seamoth, 
                    a basic submarine, and builds the vehicle. The quick 
                    Seamoth allows the player to effectively have infinite 
                    oxygen as long as the vehicle is not destroyed or they 
                    are not separated from it. The player is now inhibited 
                    by the seamoth’s crush limit (that is upgradeable) as 
                    to prevent the player from reaching the end game too 
                    quickly. (Though pressure does not affect the player 
                    outside of a vehicle in any other way than making O2 
                    less efficient).

                <p class="paragraph-padding">
                    In Act II, (or possibly Act I if the player 
                    hits certain markers first), three major events 
                    take place. The first is when the player 
                    performs a self-scan with the scan tool 
                    and is told at first that all results 
                    are nominal, but later that the player 
                    has contracted an alien bacterial i
                    nfection. The second and third require the 
                    repair tool as when the player creates the 
                    tool, they fix the radio, resulting in 
                    locations of other escape pods to be 
                    transmitted to the player over the next 
                    few hours. At one point the player is 
                    contacted by the spaceship sunbeam which 
                    eventually tries to rescue them, but is 
                    destroyed by an alien laser. This then 
                    leads the player to explore the laser and 
                    discovers the remnants of an intelligent 
                    race, including a ray gun, a doomsday 
                    device, and the building being a quarantine 
                    enforcer for the alien bacteria the player 
                    contracted.These ‘precursors’ play a major 
                    role in the story of subnautica as well as 
                    the philosophy it presents but we will touch 
                    on that later.
                </p>

                    class="image-width"

                >

                <p class="paragraph-padding">
                    The third event is the detonation of the 
                    crashed ship’s (The Aurora’s) nuclear engine, 
                    resulting in pollution in the form of radioactive leakage. The 
                    player is then encouraged to fix the leakage and stop the 
                    pollution in the environment. 

                    All these events allow for the continued exploration and 
                    uncovering of mystery in Subnautica, as the player, now 
                    equipped to travel across the surface quickly and use a 
                    wide array of tools, can travel these distances without 
                    starving, suffocating, or dehydrating. 

                    In the last event, that of the quantum detonation of the 
                    Aurora’s drive core, for most players, is one of the first 
                    times they hear the Reaper Leviathan’s roar. These giant 
                    terrifying beasts are lurking in the cloudy crash zone and 
                    elsewhere waiting to tear the player apart.
