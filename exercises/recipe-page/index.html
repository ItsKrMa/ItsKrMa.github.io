        <h1>PIZZA ROLLS - TOTINO'S COPY CAT</h1>

        <p>
            These pizza rolls were a huge part of my childhood — my mom 
            always had a stash ready for school lunches or as an after-school
            snack. Think of them as a homemade Totinos copycat, but way 
            better. Theyre piping hot, cheesy, and ooze like lava the 
            second you take a bite.

        <br>

        <h2> INSTRUCTIONS </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Make the filling:
                </b>  

                In a bowl, mix together the shredded mozzarella, 
                pizza sauce, chopped turkey pepperoni, red pepper flakes, 
                oregano, parmesan, basil, and parsley until everything is 
                well combined. Set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>
                    Stuff and assemble:
                </b>

                Have a small bowl of water ready for sealing. 
                Lay out the wonton wrappers in a diamond shape so the 
                corners point up, down, left, and right.

            </li>

            <li>
                Spoon a small dollop of filling (about 1 to 1 ½ teaspoons) 
                into the center of each wrapper.
            </li>

            <li>
                Dip your finger in water and run it along all the 
                edges of the wrapper.
            </li>

            <li>
                Fold the bottom corner up over the filling to form a triangle.
            </li>

            <li> Fold in the left and right corners toward the center. </li>

            <li>
                Then fold the top corner down and press to seal everything 
                shut like an envelope. Make sure all the edges are tightly 
                sealed so no filling leaks out.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan to 350°F (175°C). Once hot,
                carefully add the rolls in batches and fry until golden brown 
                and crispy on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and place 
                on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. 
            </li>

            <li> Serve hot with extra pizza sauce or ranch for dipping!</li>
        </ol>

        <h4> TIPS & NOTES </h4>

        <p>
            <b> Q: Can I make these ahead of time? </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A: Yes! You can assemble the rolls, cover them tightly in a 
            ziploc bag, and refrigerate them for up to a day before baking.
            You can also freeze them!
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Q: Can I freeze pizza rolls?</b>
        </p>

        <p> 
            A: Absolutely. Once rolled up, freeze them in a single layer on
            a tray, then transfer to a freezer bag. Then just fry as usual
            straight from the freezer or bake in an air fryer or oven.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> Q: How do I make these vegetarian?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A: Skip the pepperoni or any meat and load them up with your 
            favorite veggies instead! Mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, 
            olives, or spinach all work great.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Q: How do I keep the rolls from unrolling while baking?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A: Seal the edges well by pinching or brushing a little water 
            along the seam before rolling. Freezing also helps them seal up 
            better. If you choose to air fry or bake, cooking them seam-side
            down also helps lock everything in.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Q: Can I air fry pizza rolls instead of baking?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A: Yes! They get super crispy in the air fryer. Cook them at 
            375°F for 8–10 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown. 
            Just make sure to spray well with oil before air frying.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Q: How do I reheat leftovers?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A: Pop them back in the oven or air fryer for a few minutes so they 
            crisp up again. The microwave works in a pinch, but they won’t be 
            as crunchy.
